## Abstract

Autonomous; a platform which provides decentralised autonomous deployment for software and hardware using cloud infrastructure. By decentralising the control of deployment, changes to services can be made at any time and its infrastructure can be funded, owned and controlled by decentralised communities.

This platform allows for the decentralised control of software and hardware infrastructure, and is capable of bootstrapping itself to be controlled by a decentralised colony, whilst still providing services to control the deployments in other colonies. In short, the infrastructure which controls colony infrastructure is itself controlled by a colony. Autonomous can manage and run itself through a shared, open source colony and maintain decentralised control of the platform.
